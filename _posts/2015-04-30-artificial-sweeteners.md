Recent discoveries with sugar sweeteners are quite fascinating. It appears that new information is coming out all the time, thus contributing to the everlasting battle between what is “healthy” and what is not. In our modern society, most people are always searching for something “healthy,” yet sweet. Artificial sweeteners have played a huge role in the matter and many consumers have started using them in their daily life. Nevertheless, simply because artificial sweeteners state they are “healthy” does not necessarily make it true. 

According to the [Mayo Clinic](http://www.mayoclinic.org), a nonprofit medical practice and medical research group states that artificial sweeteners do pose some concerns, but the aforementioned statement regarding potential unhealthy side effects of such sweeteners is negated if consumed in moderation. This universal rule puts artificial sweeteners in the same category as others. In other words, natural cane sugar can arguably be “healthier” simply because it comes from the Earth and is not made in a lab, but if it is eaten outside the bounds of moderation, then one can be sure to experience some unfortunate health problems. 

> But according to the National Cancer Institute and other health agencies, there's no sound scientific evidence that any of the artificial sweeteners approved for use in the U.S. cause cancer or other serious health problems.

The article can be found [here](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/artificial-sweeteners/art-20046936). We must look at and consider the possibility that food products made in a lab are not necessarily healthy until proven otherwise. For now it is safe to assume that not all artificial sweeteners are bad for one’s health. If anything we can learn one important rule from this information: consume in moderation. 

>A Harvard Medical School study reported similar results in 1997. Researchers told obese women to either consume aspartame-sweetened foods or eliminate them for 16 weeks of a weight-reduction program. What happened? The women who were consuming the artificial sweetener lost significantly more weight and regained significantly less weight during the maintenance and follow-up phase.

The article [here](http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=56790) was hosted on [MedicineNet](http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/hp.asp), a world renowned trusted source that even doctor’s use to obtain more info on their patients. The article regarding the Harvard Medical School study on their site provides reassurance for those who are hesitant to consume artificial sweeteners. 

However, the article also restates that everything should be consumed in moderation, of course. 

> Remember: Everything in moderation. We can't just put all our weight-loss eggs in the artificial-sweetener basket. In other words, don't expect that simply switching to sugar-free products will help you lose weight and keep it off.
