Energy drinks are a large part of many people’s lives. Whether you’re a student, late-night employee, or just someone that needs an extra boost to get through the day, energy drinks will become your friend. However, it is common knowledge that scientifically generated beverages such as Monster™, Red Bull™, and Rockstar™ are not healthy at all. In fact, one must ask oneself if these unhealthy energy drinks are even worth it. Recent studies have confirmed that the side effects are detrimental to one’s health and possibly even life-threatening.

A an article published in February of 2015 [here](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/expert-answers/energy-drinks/faq-20058349) by the Mayo Clinic, a top-rated website and hospital offering detailed medical advice, sheds light onto the detrimental effects of energy drinks. Mayo Clinic’s Katherine Zeratsky, R.D., L.D.,  (she is certified in dietetics by the state of Minnesota and the American Dietetic Association) states that energy drinks can cause:

* Nervousness
* Irritability
* Insomnia
* Rapid heartbeat
* Increase in blood pressure

These are just a few of the unfortunate effects of overloading one’s body on caffeine and sugar. Zeratsky goes on to say a few thought provoking things regarding the intake of such drinks.

> Most energy drinks contain large amounts of caffeine, which can provide a temporary energy boost. Some energy drinks contain sugar and other substances. The boost is short-lived, however, and may be accompanied by other problems.

Another reputable source, the [U.S. News of Health](http://health.usnews.com/health-news/health-wellness/articles/2015/01/16/are-energy-drinks-really-that-bad) believes in a similar ideology, Zeratsky of Mayo Clinic previously exclaimed. 

> While experts believe it's safe for most healthy adults to consume up to 400 milligrams of caffeine a day – about the equivalent of one venti 20-ounce Starbucks coffee or two shots of 5-Hour Energy, CSPI reports – downing multiple energy drinks daily could quickly put someone over that limit, increasing their risk for headaches as well as boost blood pressure and heart rate

Clearly energy drinks can be dangerous when consumed outside of the scope of what is considered “moderation.” If you are in need of an energy boost the U.S. News’ experts state that getting good sleep, exercising or eating a snack packed with protein and complex carbohydrates can definitely help you make it through the day.
