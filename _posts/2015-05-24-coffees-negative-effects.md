Much of our world uses coffee to get through the day. However this popular commodity has proven troublesome to the human body. Though coffee can contain some benefits for us it is important to take a counterargument approach to gain insight. 

[Dr. Walter C. Willet](http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/walter-willett/) of Harvard School of Public Health shares some important information on the matter. He states that “Coffee is an amazingly potent collection of biologically active compounds, but coffee has “far reaching effects on the body and needs to be researched on their effects on human health and glucose metabolism as well.” Furthermore, [Hungry for Change](http://www.hungryforchange.tv) provides a list of reasons why you may want to quit your coffee habit:

* The caffeine in coffee increases catecholamines, your stress hormones
* Habituation to caffeine decreases insulin sensitivity, making it difficult for your cells to respond appropriately to blood sugar
* Addiction is often an issue with coffee drinkers and makes it really difficult to rely on the body’s natural source of energy
* Elevated urinary excretion of important minerals such as calcium and magnesium
Constituents in coffee can interfere with normal drug metabolism and detoxification in the liver

These are only several of the many reasons coffee isn’t your best source of energy. Remember that it is never a bad decision to take a “break” from your caffeine intake to “live your life on your own fuel.” Not only will you feel better and more energized, your overall health will improve!
