Anyone that walks through a supermarket will see an abundance of “gluten free” labeling on many of the foods. The new trend of making a product appears to be beneficial but it is important to beg the question: Can I trust labels that say “gluten free?”

The answer to the aforementioned question is not so simple. Britni Thomas, RD, LD shares some insight to understand the kind of restrictions the Food and Drug Administration has been imposing throughout the years on companies. “In August 2013, the F ruled that foods labeled gluten free need to meet specific requirements. As of August 5, 2014, all products with a gluten free label need to meet the FD's new standards. Before the FDA issued this rule that defined what characteristics a gluten-free labeled food needed to have…” Due to this, it made it difficult for consumer to trust the product was gluten free. To rectify this the FDA’s new standard is a progressive step for individuals. Furthermore, in August of 2014 CBS News provided additional informations as to why [“Gluten-free” labels now mean what they say](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/gluten-free-labels-now-mean-what-they-say/).

Up until 2014, gluten’s presence in a food was not regulated and thus it was up to the manufacture to decide what gluten amount was required. Now, the roles are reversed and food manufactures must adhere to the FDA’s rule: Anything labeled “gluten-free” can only have 20 parts per million (ppm) of gluten. 

In our society today, supermarket products and food regulations have made food shopping experiences for people with celiac disease more enjoyable and safer. So the andwer to the initial question is yes you can trust gluten-free labels!
